# SQRL Icons
A set of icons for [SQRL](https://sqrl.grc.com/).

Steve Gibson commissioned [an official icon and released it into the public domain](https://www.grc.com/sqrl/logo.htm). However, the white-on-blue color scheme may not be desirable in all situations, such as a tray icon where it doesn't match the OS theme.

This repository contains a few different styles: *dark, light, charcoal, 
chrome, hi-contrast, hi-contrast-dark, normal* (the original), and 
*reverse* (blue-on-white instead of white-on-blue.)

Each one has a vector SVG file along with transparent PNGs sized 16, 32, 64, 
128, and 256 pixels square.
